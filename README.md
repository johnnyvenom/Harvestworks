Harvestworks Resources Dropbox Repository
=========================================

#### by Johnny Sullivan | [johnnyvenom.com](http://johnnyvenom.com "Johnny Venom Media") | Jun 8, 2014

Here is a collection of free resources for things we are working on at Harvestworks, including: 

- Guides for software/hardware setup, installation, implementation, etc.
- Books
- What else?

For now it is Dropbox-based, but if we start using Git more I'll probably move it over to our Harvestworks Git account.

**Documents are written in Markdown. If you don't have a program that parses Markdown into an easy to read format (usually PDF or HTML), you can read directly from the Dropbox website.**

If you want to save a local copy, select 'Print' from the Dropbox menu options (or from your browser), and Save to PDF.

If you want something fun to play with, cut and paste raw Markdown to [Noisli.com](http://noisli.com).

If you do some coding, nearly all text editors have some Markdown parsing capability, or 3rd party extensions to work with MD. I use Sublime Text, with Markdown Preview package.

Do you have a resource that should go in here? Email me at [johnny@johnnyvenom.com](mailto:johnny@johnnyvenom.com) and I'll put it up, or share the folder with you so you can add it yourself. 


*Cheers,*
