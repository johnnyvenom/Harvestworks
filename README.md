Here is a collection of free resources for things we are working on at Harvestworks, including: 

- Guides for software/hardware setup, installation, implementation, etc.
- Books
- What else?

## **Now on GitHub!**

**Documents are written in Markdown. If you don't have a program that parses Markdown into an easy to read format (usually PDF or HTML), you can read directly from GitHub.**

If you want to save a local copy, select 'Print' from your browser), and Save to PDF.

If you want something fun to play with, cut and paste raw Markdown to [Noisli.com](http://noisli.com).

If you do some coding, nearly all text editors have some Markdown parsing capability, or 3rd party extensions to work with MD. I use Sublime Text, with Markdown Preview package.

Do you have a resource that should go in here? Email me at [johnny@johnnyvenom.com](mailto:johnny@johnnyvenom.com) and I'll put it up, or join the Harvestworks GitHub group and add it yourself!
